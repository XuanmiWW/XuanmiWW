Hi i am Joan Miquel Roca,

But you can call me Xuanmi, i am a 25 year old student from Spain.

I did 2 years of Informatic engineering but left it to study Marketing and Business Communication that i will finish in 1 year and a half.
Right now i am in a moment in life where i have plenty of time to study and i am looking for oportunities to keep growing.
I am really interested in the course, i can put my experience in coding here:

Althought doing 2 years of Informatic engineering there i didn't learnt more than C and C++ and how important syntaxis and being clean is important.
My real experience with coding, servers, and machine code comes due that my father have the career of Informatic Engineering and have been
working in his own business called (Basis Assesoria Inform√†tica S.L.).

There i learned totally html and css, i have a good lvl in php and i can defend myself in sql althought i am note a master of it.
However i learned a lot by moving website from one server to another how it works, the adaption of the versions, changing variables, etc.

My level on solidity comes from this tutorial that i am doing right know almost finishing it and putting in to practice by my own and creating a project of nfts
that i want to launch in cardano, but for that i need to know how to launch an smartcontract so i can declare everything there made it ummutable what have to be ummutable
and create a healthy project for the ecosystem of cardano.

The project will be a game of nfts of vampires vs lycanthrope. If you want more information about the idea, tokenomics(of the nfts minting etc) i would gladly
talk about it we already have our first png in a week we hope to have a randomizer ready.
So long story short i think i have a good level of programing.

If you read until here thank you very much,
Best Regards, Joan Miquel
